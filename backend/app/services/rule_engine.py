# ===========================================================================

def calculate_roundup(amount: Decimal) -> Decimal:
    """
    Return the rupee-paise difference between *amount* and the next savings
    milestone, following SpareChange AI's two-tier rounding rule:

    Tier 1 — amount has paise (fractional rupees):
        Round up to the next whole rupee.
        e.g. ₹127.60 → next whole rupee is ₹128 → roundup = ₹0.40
             ₹99.01  → ₹100 → roundup = ₹0.99

    Tier 2 — amount is already a whole rupee (no paise):
        Round up to the next multiple of 10.
        e.g. ₹145 → next multiple-of-10 is ₹150 → roundup = ₹5
             ₹140 → ₹150 → roundup = ₹10
             ₹150 → ₹160 → roundup = ₹10  (exact multiple goes to next one)

    Rationale: For digital UPI-style transactions amounts are usually whole
    rupees, so a ₹1 roundup would be negligible. Rounding to the nearest ₹10
    makes the auto-save feel meaningful without being painful.  Teams can swap
    this rule (e.g. always-to-next-100) by editing ONLY this function.

        amount: Transaction amount in INR (must be ≥ 0).
