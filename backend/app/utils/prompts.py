"""
Prompts Utility — central repository for all LLM prompt-builder functions used
across the AI Engine, keeping natural-language templates out of business-logic
modules and making them easy to version, test, and localise independently.

Architecture contract
---------------------
- Every function in this module is a PURE function: takes typed Python values
  (str, Decimal, date, list, dict) already computed by rule_engine.py, and
  returns a formatted prompt string.  No I/O, no DB access, no arithmetic.
- Functions MUST NOT compute financial values themselves.  If a number is needed
  in a prompt, the caller (router or ai_engine.py) is responsible for computing
  it via rule_engine.py BEFORE calling the builder.
- All functions return plain str — no JSON, no HTML, no markdown wrappers.
- Target: system + user prompt combined should stay under ~200 words to keep
  Llama3 latency low and responses focused.

Naming convention
-----------------
  <feature>_system_prompt()  — persona/role instruction for the LLM's system turn
  <feature>_prompt(...)      — user turn, includes real data injected by callers

No placeholders, no "lorem ipsum", no demo text is ever acceptable in a prompt
returned by these functions — callers must supply real data.
